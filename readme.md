# lkcomputervision

`lkcomputervision` is a Python package that provides a convenient interface for performing computer vision tasks using the [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/guide) library. It allows you to easily integrate hand tracking, face detection, face mesh analysis, and body pose estimation into your computer vision applications.

## Installation

To install `lkcomputervision`, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install lkcomputervision
```

# Usage

Import and initialize the package
```commandline
from lkcomputervision import MediaPipeHandler
mediapipe_handler = MediaPipeHandler()
```
**Note**: `draw` paramater controls the annotation of the frame, by default it is set to **true**

## Hand Tracking

Hand tracking allows you to detect and track hands in a given frame. You can also visualize the hand landmarks.
<br>
![](https://developers.google.com/static/mediapipe/images/solutions/hand-landmarks.png)
```python
# Track hands in a frame
hand_result = mediapipe_handler.trackHands(frame)

# Access hand landmarks
hand_landmarks = hand_result["landmarks"]

# To visualize the hand landmarks, you can use the following code:
hand_frame = hand_result["frame"]
```

#### Code
```
import cv2
from lkcomputervision import MediaPipeHandler

# Initialize the MediaPipeHandler
mp = MediaPipeHandler()

# Capture video from the webcam (you can also specify a video file path)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 represents the default webcam

while True:
    # Read a frame from the video capture
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    if not ret:
        break  # Break the loop if we can't read a frame

    # Process the frame to track hands
    result = mp.trackHands(frame)

    # Retrieve the frame with hand landmarks drawn on it
    frame_with_landmarks = result["frame"]

    # Display the frame with landmarks
    cv2.imshow("Hand Tracking", frame_with_landmarks)

    # Exit the loop when the user presses the 'q' key
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the video capture and close the OpenCV windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Face Detection

Face detection enables you to identify and locate faces in a given frame. You can also visualize the detected faces.
```python
# Detect faces in a frame
face_result = mediapipe_handler.detectFace(frame)

# Access face detection information
face_detections = face_result["landmarks"]

# To visualize the detected faces, you can use the following code:
face_frame = face_result["frame"]
```

## Face Mesh
Face mesh analysis allows you to analyze detailed facial features and landmarks in a given frame. You can also visualize the facial landmarks.
![](https://developers.google.com/static/mediapipe/images/solutions/face_landmarker_output.png)
```commandline
# Analyze face mesh in a frame
mesh_result = mediapipe_handler.faceMesh(frame)

# Access face mesh landmarks
face_mesh_landmarks = mesh_result["landmarks"]

# To visualize the face mesh landmarks, you can use the following code:
face_mesh_frame = mesh_result["frame"]
```

## Body Pose Estimation
Body pose estimation helps you detect and track key body landmarks in a given frame. You can also visualize the body pose landmarks.
![](https://learnopencv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MediaPipe-pose-BlazePose-Topology.jpg)
```commandline
# Detect body pose in a frame
pose_result = mediapipe_handler.detectPose(frame)

# Access body pose landmarks
pose_landmarks = pose_result["landmarks"]

# To visualize the body pose landmarks, you can use the following code:
pose_frame = pose_result["frame"]
```

## Detect All landmarks
You can perform all analyses together in a single call and access the results as a dictionary. *Please note that due to the potential impact on frame rate, visualization of the results may not be optimal in real-time applications.*

```commandline
# Perform all analyses together
all_detections = mediapipe_handler.detectAll(frame)

# Access all landmarks
hand_landmarks = all_detections["handTracking"]
face_detections = all_detections["detectFace"]
face_mesh_landmarks = all_detections["faceMesh"]
pose_landmarks = all_detections["detectPose"]
```
